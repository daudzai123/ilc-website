Place your provided logo image into this folder and name it `logo.png` (or update Header.tsx to point at a different filename). The uploaded logo you provided in chat should be used as the main brand mark.

To set the homepage background, save the image you uploaded in chat as `home-hero.png` in this folder (`public/images/home-hero.png`). The Home page uses that file as a cover-style hero background.

Also replace the placeholder SVGs in `team`, `courses`, and `events` with your actual images.
