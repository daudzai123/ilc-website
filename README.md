# ILC Website (Next.js)

This project is a Next.js + TypeScript starter for the IQ Leading Center website. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes sample pages: Home, About, Courses, Team, Events, Contact.

Brand colors are set from the provided logo. Replace the placeholder logo at `public/images/logo.png` with your provided file (preserve the filename).

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`

Notes:
- The map on Contact uses React-Leaflet (no API key required).
- The Events slider will use Swiper.
- Replace placeholder images in `public/images/*` with your real assets.

Brand colors:
- Primary (nav/headers): #0B2A63 (deep navy)
- Secondary (accent/red): #D92B2B
- Accent (gold): #F2C94C

If you want any color tweaks or font choices, tell me which and I’ll update the styles.
